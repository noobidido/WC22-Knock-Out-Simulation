# WC22 Knock-Out Simulation

The FIFA world cup is considered the greatest show on earth by many. And rightly so. No other event brings these much people closer, people of different gender, race, religion, people from every corner of the world. The emotion behind this event is simply unmatched. For a month almost every person in this world is following the world cup.

For the very first time, this year the FIFA world cup is being held in Qatar. The group stage of the tournament is already completed and it was probably the most competitive and uncertain of all the world cups in the recent times. Many footballing giants were knocked out of the tournament and many not-so-big teams in the traditional sense qualified for the RO16. 

This world cup features a lot of great teams, who are very likely to win the World Cup. And also a lot of teams capable of pulling some upsets and writing everyone's favorite world cup fairy tales. In a world cup like this, it is almost impossible to make any predictions. But it is not stopping regular football fans and new football fans.
